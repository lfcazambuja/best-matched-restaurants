The final submitted work should include a README file. No UI is required in this assessment, but you may implement one if you would like.
The steps to run and test your program should be clearly introduced in the README file.
If you have made any additional Assumptions besides what we have listed above while working on this assessment, please document them so that we can better understand your solution.

Feel free to note down which areas you choose not to focus on if needed.

Please be sure to save this file as runnable code (with instructions) and as a publicly accessible file.
